#!/bin/bash

# This script is meant to be the entrypoint for OpenShift Bash scripts to import all of the support
# libraries at once in order to make Bash script preambles as minimal as possible. This script recur-
# sively `source`s *.sh files in this directory tree. As such, no files should be `source`ed outside
# of this script to ensure that we do not attempt to overwrite read-only variables.
